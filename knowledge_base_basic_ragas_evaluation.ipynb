With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, and you only pay for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. To use AWS Lambda, you simply upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically run from other AWS services, or you can call it directly from any web or mobile app.',\n",

       " 'retrieved_contexts': ['Amazon ECS has two modes: Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type. With Fargate launch type, all you have to do is package your application in containers, specify the CPU and memory requirements, define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application. EC2 launch type allows you to have server-level, more granular control over the infrastructure that runs your container applications. With EC2 launch type, you can use Amazon ECS to manage a cluster of servers and schedule placement of containers on the servers. Amazon ECS keeps track of all the CPU, memory and other resources in your cluster, and also finds the best server for a container to run on based on your specified resource requirements.     You are responsible for provisioning, patching, and scaling clusters of servers. You can decide which type of server to use, which applications and how many containers to run in a cluster to optimize utilization, and when you should add or remove servers from a cluster. EC2 launch type gives you more control of your server clusters and provides a broader range of customization options, which might be required to support some specific applications or possible compliance and government requirements.
