    "# RAG Evaluation using Amazon Bedrock Evaluation\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can very quickly build a basic evaluation suite using syntethic data generation, then grow from there.  \n",
    "We pick RAG as the task to evaluate. The RAG is implemented using Bedrock Knowledge Base.\n",
    "The evaluation software is Bedrock Evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge over RAG generation.  \n",

    "### Workshop Flow\n",
    "Here are the main steps of this RAG Evaluation Workshop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose Your Dataset** - Select the business data you want to benchmark your RAG system with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Bedrock Knowledge Base** - Upload your document to S3 and create a knowledge base pointing to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate Synthetic Evaluation Set** - Use Bedrock Playground with Sonnet 3.7 to create Q&A pairs from your document.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improve Evaluation Set & Upload to S3** - Review the synthetic data, make improvements, and upload to S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sync & Verify Knowledge Base** - Ensure your knowledge base has properly indexed the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Run RAG Evaluation** - Use Bedrock Evaluations to test different models and configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compare Evaluation Results** - Analyze the performance data to determine the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
